# AI-Website
## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to build a front end for users to input data into the website and retrieve a prediction from the models built in the [Data Science Repository](https://github.com/KishanYern/Data-Science-Repository). 

## Technologies Used
I used React and Tailwindcss to build the frontend and Flask to build the backend.
